# Collection Database Updater
I created this as a way to keep track of all the things I collect such as movies and comic books. 

For a long time I have used an excel file to keep track of all the comic books and movies that I currently own and but was wanting to build something a bit more advanced using python and some other skills that I have been developing over time.  

The basis of this project is to use a python script that takes input from myself based on various factors and updates a database stored on a postgreSQL server that is stored locally on my network.
